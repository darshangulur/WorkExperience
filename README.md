# WorkExperience - Projects

## Senior Consultant, Capgemini, Atlanta, GA	                                                                 06/16 – Present
### Part of the iOS development team for Chick-fil-A (CFA) flagship application (4+ rating) catering to a 2m+ active user base, #1 on Food & Drink Category on multiple occasions and consistently in top 10, Highest ranking - #37 across all App store categories

1. Re-writing an entire project in 100% Swift with a custom-VIPER design pattern, consisting in excess of 200k lines of code. With custom-VIPER, I created a module per screen, creating separation of concerns between Interfaces, View, Navigation, Data Interactor and module creation layers. This pattern helped in reusing the modules efficiently across overlapping features, with dependency injection at the module creation layer, as a result increasing testability of source code. Other patterns also implemented viz. MVC, Protocol oriented, Facade, Factory, Observable and Singleton. Functional and Declarative Style.

2. Wrote unit test cases with XCTest and Nimble test frameworks and used OHHTTPStubs to mock network requests. Achieved more than 50% test coverage across the project, resulting in highly testable network, data access and view model layers.

3. [Highlighted Placeholder for describing one or two frameworks being asked for in Job Description and used in this project. The description should be in the following format: Action, Implementation and Result. If multiple frameworks for, then description should be split into multiple items.]

4. Implemented UI and Auto layout 100% in code, providing easiest way to apply style and extreme reusability.

5. Implemented Continuous Integration-Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) build process between BitBucket, Jenkins with fastlane build scripts and Hockey App, efficiently tracking multiple versions of builds across environments.

6. Investigated app store feedbacks and crash reports, used logging info, Network Link Conditioner tool and Xcode Instruments and brought down avg. unique crash count from double digits to below 10, which is an all-time low for this project.

7. Problem: In mobile order dine-in flow, customer despite ordering thru mobile, had to go in queue to register desk and collect an identification object tagged to the order & take a seat, which introduces an unnecessary wait time for the customer.
Solution: I implemented a BLE-based beacon solution into the app to track the movement of Customer entering restaurant & taking a seat and at the same time notifying restaurant to prepare the order & deliver to the exact table customer is seated at.
Result: This solution provided a magical customer experience, while also solving one of the important problems at restaurants with high traffic during peak hours, cutting down avg. wait time of a customer by 50%. Also helped CFA team members know Customer’s exact table number which is an imp. info especially for multistoried restaurants in Manhattan, NY.

Frameworks: Realm, AFNetworking, IGListKit, ThreatMetrix, Observables, TinyConstraints, Taplytics, mParticle, Bluetooth
Tools: Xcode, Source Tree, Bitbucket, JIRA, Carthage, Jenkins, fastlane, Hockey App, Charles Proxy, Swagger, Amplitude, Slack

## Consultant, Capgemini, Bangalore, India	                                                                     11/13 – 12/14
### Responsible for developing & Managing SUP (Sybase Unwired Platform) and Rest web services driven Enterprise Mobility solutions on iOS and Android platforms for clients viz. Procter & Gamble, John Deere, Ikea, J&J and SO.IN.

1. PetCare Loyalty Project: Implemented UI-rich Master-Detail hierarchical design loaded with data in the form of MBOs (Mobile Business Objects) from an SUP source. MVC pattern was followed and dependency injection was implemented to have the data objects flow into detail screens with necessary abstraction. Data Objects were mostly of type NSSet and NSOrderedSet to make sure objects are unique and order in the list is maintained for certain screens. The application as a whole converted P&G’s Pet Care Loyalty business from paper-based to 100% digital.

2. WINGiT Project: Worked on Create and Browse events sections of the project designed in MVC pattern using fragments and adapters for reusability, driven by REST web services to develop a social networking Android application that brings together best of local events from various social platforms aggregated at the backend.

3. Reports Viewer Project: Developed an iPad application that reads MS Excel input files via REST web services and generates dynamic, interactive, 2-way scrollable grid dashboard with hierarchical design, which is achieved in a unique way using two collection views at right angles to scroll together both horizontally and vertically. Search to view date specific data, filter data based on tags, and sort by tapping on column headers. The application eliminated the manual work of data analysis by 100% and brought down analysis and actionable time for each report from 10 minutes to less than 30 seconds.

Frameworks: Foundation, UIKit, CoreData, CoreLocation, MapKit, JASON, AVFoundation
